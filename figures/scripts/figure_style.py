Coupling-Induced Multistability, Re-entrant Dynamics, and Chaotic Temporal
Switching in Mutually Coupled Third-Order Phase-Locked Loops
===============================================================================

Script:
    figure_style.py

Purpose:
    Briefly describe the specific computational analysis performed by this
    script and its role in the overall study.

Study context:
    This script is part of the computational workflow used to investigate
    coupling-induced multistability, synchronization loss, re-entrant P/M
    regime selection, and temporal switching in mutually coupled third-order
    phase-locked loops.

Physical regime convention:
    P regime: (D1, D2) = (+, -)
    M regime: (D1, D2) = (-, +)

    P and M denote finite-time detector-phase drift orientations. They should
    not be interpreted automatically as distinct asymptotic attractors.

Inputs:
    - List the required input files, parameters, or outputs from earlier
      scripts.
    - Use "None" when the script is self-contained.

Outputs:
    - List the principal CSV, NPZ, JSON, PNG, PDF, or other generated files.
    - Identify output directories when appropriate.

Manuscript relevance:
    - Section: [Methods/Results section]
    - Figure/Table: [Figure X, Table X, Supplementary Figure SX, or N/A]
    - Principal result: [one-sentence description]

Reproducibility:
    This program is part of the reproducibility repository accompanying the
    manuscript. Numerical classifications and dynamical interpretations should
    be understood within the finite-time framework described in the paper.
